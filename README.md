A security alarm is a system designed to detect intrusion – unauthorized entry – into a building or area. These are used in residential, commercial, industrial, and military properties for protection against burglary (theft) or property damage, as well as personal protection against intruders. Keeping such idea in mind i have created an app which will detect such intrusions using the following circuit with the help of arduino, bluetooth and photo-resistor.
